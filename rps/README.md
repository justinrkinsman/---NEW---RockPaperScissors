Introduction
This Rock, Paper, Scissors game was one of the first projects I attempted to build. I initially built a very rudimentary version that was mostly text-based. I came back nearly a year later with the intention of making it look more profesisonal and showcasing off my CSS skills

Conclusion
When I initially completed the Rock, Paper, Scissors project back in May of 2022, it was one of the most rewarding victories of my life. It was my first real coding challenge where I figured it all out myself. I knew then that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that this was just the first step on that lifelong journey

Thanks for playing, and for reading!
