# Introduction

This Rock, Paper, Scissors game was one of the first projects I attempted to build. I initially built a very rudimentary version that was mostly text-based. I came back nearly a year later with the intention of making it look more professional and showcasing my CSS skills.

# How to play

Click start to begin a new game. Input your name and the game will begin.

Select between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

# Winning Conditions:

PAPER beats ROCK  
ROCK beats SCISSORS  
SCISSORS beats ROCK

If your guess beats the computer's guess, you win. First to win five rounds wins the game. You will then be able to choose between starting a new game and resetting the scores to 0, or entering a new name.

# Features

The front-end of this project was built using React. The intention of the project is to showcase my design skills more so than my coding prowess and was mostly meant as a fun refresher on CSS for me.

# Conclusion

When I initially completed the Rock, Paper, Scissors project back in May of 2022, it was one of the most rewarding victories of my life. It was my first real coding challenge where I figured it all out myself. I knew then that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that this was just the first step on that lifelong journey

Thanks for playing, and for reading!
